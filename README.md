# GithubS3AngularApp

This project is for my YouTube video on how to automatically update file contents on an AWS S3 bucket using github and CodeBuild (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMSdM2dj_el). In the video, I use an angular app deployment (build the project and upload build files to S3) as an example. This approach can be used for other applications as well.
